- is what
    - TF-slim is a new lightweight high-level API of TensorFlow (tensorflow.contrib.slim) for defining, training and evaluating complex models. 
- Why TF-Slim ?
    - TF-Slim is a library that makes defining, training and evaluating neural networks simple:
        - Allows the user to define models much more compactly by eliminating boilerplate code. This is accomplished through the use of argument scoping and numerous high level layers and variables. These tools increase readability and maintainability, reduce the likelihood of an error from copy-and-pasting hyperparameter values and simplifies hyperparameter tuning.
        - Makes developing models simple by providing commonly used regularizers.
        - Several widely used computer vision models (e.g., VGG, AlexNet) have been developed in slim, and are available to users. These can either be used as black boxes, or can be extended in various ways, e.g., by adding "multiple heads" to different internal layers.
        - Slim makes it easy to extend complex models, and to warm start training algorithms by using pieces of pre-existing model checkpoints.
